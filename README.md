To control the normal dragon you must click to start controlling (as it starts
in an automatic flying mode and you must switch to manual). For the school
dragon, you are already in manual mode and the dragon will fly vaguely towards
your mouse (the vertical axis maps to the dragon's pitch, but the horizontal
axis maps to the dragon's yaw speed). You can click the screen in the school
dragon to switch to 3rd person view. Controlling in this mode is much harder
though.
